## ðŸ§¸ Get comfortable

In my experience there are two areas of professional development when it comes to
working openly:


* Developing skills
* Developing comfort

I've noticed the latter is a larger challenge for many researchers.


# How to help others get comfortable?

Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

This is hard. Are there any patterns?


## ðŸ§ª What's worked

The following solutions have worked in my communities:

* Concern about "scooping" or intellectual theft
  * **Include [authorship metadata](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) with code**
  * **Use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to archive intermediate steps**

* Concern about failing publicly
  * **Share positive failure interactions**

* Concern about loss of ownership
  * **Establish a community governance model**
