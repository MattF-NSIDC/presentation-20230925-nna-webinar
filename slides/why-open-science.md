## ðŸŒŸ A better way to work

Open science is a **better way to work**, not simply a new set of funding requirements.

In my experience, working openly:

* Optimizes outcomes
* Optimizes professional growth
* Optimizes fun


## ðŸ”¬ Optimizes outcomes

* We **know more** when we know how a result was achieved
* We have **better ideas** when we discuss them with others
* We are **more accurate** when others check our work


## ðŸŒ± Optimizes professional growth

* Working with more collaborators yields **more opportunities to learn and network**
* Being conscious of collaboration enables **crediting critical support roles that are
  less-often credited**


## ðŸ¥³ Optimizes fun

* Working openly **draws in passionate and fun people**
